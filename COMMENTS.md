# Known issues

### Poor variaty of movies available. 
Movies used in pages are from popular and trending movie requests. I've reused movies I've fetched from home page, to keep the scope smaller for the app. Finished version should have more requests for bigger variety and bigger movie selection.

### No unit testing
Wanted to move as fast as I can with my limited hours to get the most work done. 

### Not a lot of pages
Probably could have added more pages, but again, focused more on finishing and kept the scope smaller.

### Actors section in movie info page
Couldn't think of a visually appealing way to list actors. God bless designers in dev teams.

### Horizontal scroll in MovieScroller
At least on my PC it's not very smooth and I wanted to add horizontal scroll with mouse wheel on mouse over, but I couldn't succeed quickly and ditched the idea to not waste too much time on it.
